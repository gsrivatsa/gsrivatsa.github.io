Hi, My name is Srivatsa Gunturi. I have been working as a design engineer at Intel Corporation from May, 2016. Before this, I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently working in FPGA group at Intel, where my work is in the intersection of HW/SW. My work involves designing System Verilog Models of Hardened Transciever Subsystems in FPGA Devices that gets shipped with Intel Quartus Prime tool and sometimes also involves in designing software models of hardened IP blocks that Quartus Tool uses as the database to run its algorithms to configure the FPGA Transceiver Susystem.
